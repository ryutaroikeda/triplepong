**** Features ****
- Pong for three players.
- Two players move the rackets. The third player moves the ball.
- The players rotate roles after each round. The game ends after three rounds,
  and the player with the highest score wins.
- The rackets and the ball are moved by pressing <SPACE>. Each press causes the
  racket to jump a little. Without input, the rackets and ball fall due to 
  gravity.
- play online
- speed of racket on contact influences ball velocity

**** Optional ****
- AI player
- Chatroom
- smartphone app
- website
- browser version

- Lag compensation
We want the user to experience as little  network latency as possible. To 
achieve this, we can perform lag compensation on the server. The server and 
client keep a record of the game state and inputs for each frame up to about 2L 
frames, where L is the latency (more precisely, the number of frames that would 
be played in that time). When the client presses a key, the game responds 
immediately. At the same time, the client sends the key press together with the 
frame number f to the server. After about L frames, the server receives these. 
To compensate for the lag L, the server rewinds to the frame when the key was 
pressed and replays all the key events received since that time. The server 
then sends back all key events and the frame number f + L. The client receives 
these after another L frames. The client can then similarly rewind to frame f 
and replay any keys since that time to compute the current state.

**** Old, kept for reference ****
There is a problem when the client enters a key between frames f and f + L. 
When the client receives the state from the server at f + 2L, we only rewind 
to f + L. Since what we receive is only a response to events up to time f, 
any event between f and f + L, say f + e  will not be taken into account. To 
the client, it will look as if that event was 'cancelled' - until the client 
receives the reply for it at time f + e + 2L. A workaround would be to 
prohibit key presses for L frames after the last.
